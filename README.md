# CampChess

## Local Deployment

To set this up, clone this repository, run the `bundle install` command to ensure you have all the needed gems and then create the database with `rake db:migrate`.  If you want to populate the system, you can run the `rake db:populate` command.  The populate script will create a series of curriculum, instructors and over 35 camps

After running these series of commands, run `rails s` to begin the server. The server should run on localhost:3000
